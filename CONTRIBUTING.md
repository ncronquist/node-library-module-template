## Workflow

- Fork and clone the project
- Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

- Run the lint and format checks

```sh
npm run lint
```

- Fix lint / format checks that can be repaired automatically

```sh
npm run lint-fix
```

- Make sure to add tests for your changes. Watch the tests

```sh
npm run test-watch
```

- When you're ready with your new changes, update the version in the
  package.json file based on [SemVer standards][semver].
